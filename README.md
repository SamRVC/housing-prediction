# housing-prediction
## About
I created this project to use as a portfolio item to help demonstrate my data science skills. This project uses the Ames Housing dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset) on kaggle. The dataset contains a records of home sales from the early 2000s and a multitude of attributes about each home at the time of sale. 

The goal of this project is to create a classification model to predict the final price the home was sold at. I use pearson correlation, one-hot encoding, factor analysis and eigenvalues to determine the best method and explication of my decision tree classifier. I also use hypothesis testing and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin's test to justify the usage of factor analysis.

This project is to act as a demonstration of my ability to not only preform statical analysis, but to show that I can preform all of these operations with clean code.
## Usage
This project uses [plotly](https://plotly.com/) to create and render it's visualizations, however Github does not render non-static pages, meaning my visualizations will not appear if you view [housing-prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/SamRVC/housing-prediction/blob/main/housing-prediction.ipynb) within Github. I have created static matplotlib equivalents that will be rendered within the Github view. If you would like to view the intractable visualizations I create within this project, you are free to download and run my code. If you would prefer not to do so, I have also provided an [html](https://github.com/SamRVC/housing-prediction/blob/main/housing-prediction.html) rendering of the notebook you can download and view instead.
